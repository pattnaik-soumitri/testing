    <ins>**About Project**</ins>

    Currently I am working on a healthcare application named *Caren*. 
    In th United States, there are more than 49% of families where both married-couples are working. In such families it becomes difficult for the couples to take care of their elders (parents, grand parent, in laws etc.). To solve this problem US has many home healthcare providers called **hospices**, for the elders to live.
    Hospices have trained professionals called care givers who usually take care of the elderly person.
    In the Unites States more than 70% of the people older than 60 years are having at least two health conditions, so it becomes extremely important for the hospices to provide means to start or continue diagnosis, monitor the vitals (etc) for the elders.
    
    That's where Caren comes into the picture. In Caren the caregivers or the elders themselves (elders are called **Patient** in Caren) use our apps (mobile and web) to :
    - Track patient's vitals such as BP, Glucose level, SpO2 level, Body temperature, Pain level etc.
    - Manage meals and medication timings.
    - Track health conditions, observations, side effects, Emergency Room Visits, Vaccinations etc.

    Caregivers or the patients themselves can enter their readings and observations and doctors and other family members of their family can monitor their loved ones in Caren.
    
    <ins>**Mention the followings if asked for more details**</ins>
    
    - Caren also has **Interoperability** where it can automatically sync readings for patients who are using *iHealth* or *Omoron* health care devices (iHealth and Omoron are health care device manufacturer).
    - We are currently working EHR (Electronic Health Record) interoperability. We are currently working with **Cerner EHR** where doctors / hospitals using Cerner EHR can have their patient's vitals and observations being taken and synced to the EHR seamlessly from home using Caren app.
    - We have functionality in the app to manage legal documents such as insurances, wills etc.
